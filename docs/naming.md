# Naming

## File Name

By default, all files are named using the following pattern: `name-type.extension`, example: `input-section.jsx`.

### React Components

All React components are creating using the jsx extension, using the default pattern.

### Style

Since the style is made using SCSS, all files are named using the component name followed by `*.styles.scss`, example: `input-section.styles.scss`

### Tests

Tests use the pattern `component-name.test.js`.
